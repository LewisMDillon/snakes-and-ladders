# SNAKES AND LADDERS

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

In this section, you will include a few paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your "sales pitch".

At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it!
Don't introduce the project as a "portfolio project" for the diploma.

In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target, and how it will be useful to the target audience.

Consider adding a mockup image using the "Am I Responsive" website.
Here's your deployed site as an example:
https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://lewismdillon.github.io/snakes-and-ladders

Screenshots for the README and testing should not be inside of `assets/` or `static/` image folders.
(reminder: `assets/` and `static/` are for files used on the live site, not documentation)
Consider adding a new folder called `documentation`, and add the amiresponsive screenshot inside of that folder.
To add the image into your README, use this format:
(assuming you have a new folder called `documentation` with an image called "mockup.png")

![screenshot](documentation/mockup.png)

Note: Markdown files (.md) should not contain HTML elements like `img`, `br`, `div`, `a`, etc, only Markdown formatting.

## UX
The aim with the user interface in this project is to provide clear and concise options to the user. The gameboard of snakes and ladders is necessarily busy and cluttered so the other elements were kept as minimal as possible.

The user is presented with the gameboard and the game setup in one screen to prevent having to scroll up and down to access options. HTML elements are added and removed depending on the game state so as to keep the game area clean and un-cluttered.

Large buttons and fonts make it easy for the user to interact with the different elements and recieve information back from them.

Color-dependent text is used to further clarify things such as turn states.


### Colour Scheme

The site uses bright, pastel colours for the gameboard elements with accented blue elements for the fonts and buttons. Player pieces are also brightly coloured, but using strong, bold primary and secondary colours so as to draw the eye of the user and allow them to instantly spot their piece on the gameboard.

- `#3d999a` used for primary text.
- `#327e80` used for primary highlights.
- `#ffe8cc` used for gameboard.
- `#ff9e40` used for gameboard.
- `#9ad6d7` used for gameboard.
- `#ffcdb6` used for gameboard.
- `#bc91d9` used for gameboard.

Consider adding a link and screenshot for your colour scheme using "coolors".
https://coolors.co/generate

When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

Google Fonts as used for all main fonts in the site

Google Material Symbols & Icons, as well as FontAwesome were used for icons


- [Yanone Kaffeesatz](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yanone+Kaffeesatz) was used for the primary headers and titles.

## Features

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!
